# Description of the problem statement
* The React application you described is a joke generator that displays jokes based on different categories. It consists of cards representing each category, and when a user clicks on a card, a message box pops up displaying random jokes related to that category. link - https://prashantkr29.github.io/ReactAssignment/

* Category Cards: The UI initially displays several category cards, each representing a different joke category. These cards can be designed as clickable elements, such as buttons or tiles.
* Click Event: When a user clicks on a category card, it triggers a click event associated with that card. This event is captured and handled by the React component responsible for the card.
* For the Message box , I have bulit a separate react application as i was facing some techinal fault while combining the message box component with the main react application
